# Magento 2 Advanced Wishlist Extension

To begin with, the <strong>Advanced </strong><b>Wishlist Extension</b> is developed based on the wishlist function of Magento core but added many special features to enhance the customer experience in online stores. Like normal wishlist function, the fundamental purpose of this extension is to help buyers to save their wanted products to see the next time. The difference is that after choosing items to save, the <strong>Magento Advanced </strong><b>Wishlist</b> also enables purchasers to create a specific group to save in. These groups can be created based on product categories (shoes, cosmetics, trousers,…), user purposes (stuff bought for family/ companies/ themselves), and so on.

Especially, for buyers that get used to shopping online routinely, the extension will help them enormously to avoid time-consuming and repeated tasks – searching, adding products to the cart - to repurchase again and again. They just need to check their last Wishlist and then modify it if needed or go directly to the checkout step.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;">Instantly Add Products to the Wishlist</span></h2>
  
The customers can instantly add their favorite items to the wishlist when they are on the <em><b>Homepage, Category Page, Product Page</b></em> or even <em><b>Shopping Cart</b></em>.

<li><strong>On the Homepage</strong></li>

What they need to do is click on the wishlist icon, choose product attributes (quantity, color, size, ...), and then select a group to add that product.
In case there are no available groups or the customers want to save the product in a new group, they can easily create a new one directly on the wishlist popup.

<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;">Easily Create and Manage Product Groups with Advanced Wishlist</span></h2>
  
Besides creating a new group right when adding products to the wishlist, the customers can more actively generate a new one in their account dashboard.

In <em><b>My Wishlist</b></em>, the extension offers a variety of functions to help the users manage their groups effectively:
<ul class="features-listing">
 	<li>Take notes/ write a description for each group or item in the group</li>
 	<li>Delete unwanted product(s) or the whole group</li>
 	<li>Move an item to another appropriate group</li>
 	<li>View and Update product attributes (quantity, color, size,…)</li>
 	<li>Add all/ any product(s) to the cart directly in <em><b>My Wishlist</b></em></li>
</ul>

<div class="col-md-8 col-2">Sometimes, the purchasers might forget the useful Wishlist that they had created before. Owing to that, the <strong>Advanced</strong> <b>Wishlist Extension</b> gives the customers an opportunity to subscribe and receive Wishlist notification emails. In addition, the users can decide when sending reminder emails and the number of reminders in the <em><b>My Wishlist</b></em> configuration.</div>
  
<h2><span style="font-size: medium; color: #000080;">Freely Share Favorite Wishlist on Social Networks Or Via Email</span></h2>
  
This special <b>Wishlist Extension</b> allows the customers to share their favorite wishlist on the four most popular social networks including <b><em> Facebook, Pinterest, Twitter,</em></b> and <b><em> Google Plus</em></b>. Then, their friends can consider those shared posts as precious references or suggestions for their shopping.

Moreover, the wishlist owner can send an email to anyone to share their wishlist. Consequently, the store owner can enjoy benefits indirectly: more and more people know about their products without spending huge money on promotions.
